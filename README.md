# Latency_Prediction_for_Mobile_Phones

This repository contains code for predicting latency in mobile phones. The code uses machine learning algorithms to analyze mobile phone data and predict the latency of various applications and processes.

Latency is the delay that occurs between a user's input and the device's response. In mobile phones, latency can be caused by a variety of factors, such as slow processor speed, low memory, or a weak network connection. High latency can cause applications and processes to run slowly or even crash, leading to a frustrating user experience.
